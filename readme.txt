The Gaboinked! Chipin Sidebar Widget allows you to configure and output a Chipin fundraising or donation widget in your self-hosted WordPress or WordPress MU blog Sidebar.

== Description ==
ChipIn allows you to collect money for a personal cause, group purchase, or fundraiser using your own custom Chipin Widget which is displayed on your blog or website.

With your PayPal account, you are able to create an interactive widget that allows you to raise money directly through blogs and other social media.  Non-profit organizations are empowered to engage a distributed network of supporters in 'blograising' campaigns for major fundaising efforts.

Until now, there was not a WordPressive solution to easily display a Chipin Widget in a self-hosted WordPress Sidebar without having to hard-code your template with the widget code supplied by Chipin for WordPress Blogs.  The existing Chipin method for adding a Chipin Widget was probably intended for a WordPress.com hosted blog, and depends on the use of <embed></emded> tags within the post itself to display a Chipin Widget.

The Gaboinked! Chipin Sidebar Widget for WordPress allows WordPress bloggers to configure and display a Chipin Widget on self-hosted WordPress blog sidebars.  This is a convenient way for visitors to donate funds to any cause or event you wish. The Gaboinked! Chipin Sidebar Widget is a social fundraising solution for WordPress 2.0 and above, tested up to WordPress 2.5.1 compatible.
